# CrateKeys

some fuckin items, from  a chest, upon tapping by an emerald. 

Probably the simplest, best one... keeps chest closed, any chest can be used, even if your personal chest, you can open the chest if you aren't holding an emerald, but there is one in your inventory... also made it so the items are given to your inventory rather than being spewed out on the ground.   LIKE WTF !

Here, fixed.

hold emerald, hit any chest, receive 1 of set items at random into your inventory. 
store emeralds (create keys) by opening your chest holding any item other than an emerald, or by bare hand. 

Emeralds are taken when used even if renamed to something other than 'Emerald'

NOT HARD.
